\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgbd96d16}

The following IT policies will form the basis IT policy framework for our corporation. Like many companies in the IT health care space, our company is concerned with big-data analytics as a means of controlling costs and gaining competitive advantage \citep{milenkovicBigDataAnalytics2019,dolezelBigDataAnalytics2019}; focusing on cloud computing as a means of increasing innovation \citep{linCloudComputingInnovation2012,mallmannAdoptionCloudComputing2018,karunagaranDifferentialCloudAdoption2019}, as well as increasing reliability and performance at reduced cost \citep{andradePerformabilityEvaluationCloudBased2019,khayerCloudComputingAdoption2020}. Therefore our policies should reflect the needed security and operational concerns of a distributed environment that is hosted in a hybrid cloud environment.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nature of Revisions}
\label{sec:org26be483}

28-Aug-2021: This is the initial version of this policy written from a perspective of a unified corporate policy. Prior policy covering this topic was written at a department level. All such department level policies must meet the minimum standards set forth in this policy from the effective date of this policy. This revision has proceeded through the documented centralized IT business process management system including all review phases \cite{wagleDevelopmentEffectiveCentralized2021}.

\subsubsection{Purpose of the Policy}
\label{sec:org39f2d93}

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for the introduction of new technology into the corporate network environment including associated virtual private cloud computing environments hosted by contracted cloud providers.

\subsubsection{Policy}
\label{sec:org6c6bf83}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Scope
\label{sec:org738549e}

This policy applies to all individuals tasked with introducing new technology architectures or device types into the environment of the corporation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sanctions
\label{sec:org1f99ff3}

Any personnel who violates this policy will be referred to HR for disciplinary action. Such action may include but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item A notification of policy violation in personnel file
\item A limitation on compensation increases for the current rewards cycle
\item Removal of access from one or more information systems
\item Termination
\item Legal action

\item Other actions not listed here
\end{itemize}

Note: installing unapproved devices is a serious security breech that could jeopardize the company and its stakeholders greatly, actions less than immediate termination will require exigent circumstances.
\end{enumerate}

\item Expectations
\label{sec:org982f2c6}

It is the expectation that no technology will be introduced into the network, VPCs, or otherwise connected into the corporate owned and controlled computing environment without first obtaining proper review and approval.

\item Approval Process
\label{sec:orga20f414}

Devices for use within the environment shall be chosen from the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), which contains the listing of all approved device configurations for use within the corporate network environment, include cloud VPC environments. This list is maintained by the IT Architecture team and is updated at least quarterly according to their internal processes, but often more frequently as patches, security updates, and other configuration data is updated by manufacturers.

Requests for a new technology, device type, or system that is not currently part of the CMDB will be processed through the Architecture request portal. Approval will be subject to review for fitness according to criteria related to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Total cost of ownership
\item Fitness to purpose
\item Security standards
\item Maintainability
\item Available Alternatives
\item etc.
\end{itemize}

Once approved, new devices may be ordered through the standard procurement system process request portal.

\item Technology Roadmap
\label{sec:org2b7a0fa}

Each year, Architecture will update the Technology Roadmap which will present the projected target technology state for the coming:

\begin{itemize}
\item year
\item 3-year
\item 5-year
\end{itemize}

time windows. WHile it is certainly the case that the 3- and 5-year projects are at best rough estimates, this roadmap provides a guidepost by which teams can plan for the future expansion. The 1-year roadmap will be maintained to include proven technologies that are available on the market today.

\item Verification
\label{sec:org237b151}

Verification of the above will be conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\item Regular system scans will be run against the CMDB to ensure that no unapproved devices are in the environment
\item Any unapproved devices will be immediately quarantined from the network by automated processes for security reasons
\item Any unapproved devices will be flagged as a severity 1 ticket for removal from the environment
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Overall Responsibility}
\label{sec:org1831ee7}

Overall responsibility for this policy is IT Architecture. General questions about this policy can be directed to the Help Desk. Legal questions about this policy can be directed to the legal team.

\subsection{Hardware and Software Acquisition Standards Policy}
\label{sec:org54f141e}

\begin{itemize}
\item Applies to: All employees
\item Policy Number: 005
\item Effective Date of This Version: 28-Aug-2021
\item Supersedes the Version Dated: N/A
\item Policy Sponsor: Purchasing
\item Original Effective Date: 28-Aug-2021
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nature of Revisions}
\label{sec:orge9c9506}

28-Aug-2021: This is the initial version of this policy written from a perspective of a unified corporate policy. Prior policy covering this topic was written at a department level. All such department level policies must meet the minimum standards set forth in this policy from the effective date of this policy. This revision has proceeded through the documented centralized IT business process management system including all review phases \cite{wagleDevelopmentEffectiveCentralized2021}.

\subsubsection{Purpose of the Policy}
\label{sec:orgde61e48}

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements for the acquisition of hardware and software for the company.

\subsubsection{Policy}
\label{sec:org4836e1c}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Scope
\label{sec:org59c7322}

This policy applies to all employees, manager level and above who have been assigned WBS accounts with purchasing signatory authority.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Exceptions:
\label{sec:org0c8ba64}

On rare occasions it may be necessary to grant exceptions to this policy. It is recognized that the speed of business may mean that normal procurement channels may need to be bypassed in some exceptional circumstances. Managers otherwise authorized under this policy may obtain approval from a director level or higher to utilize their own judgment to bypass this policy and make purchases utilizing their corporate charge card to expedite a purchase. Such purchase are undertaken at the manager's own risk and should the purchase ultimately not be approved as a legitimate business expense, the manager will be fully personally liable for any such purchase. However, if approved, the manager will be fully reimbursed and no penalty will ensue. Purchases made in this manner will not be subject to sanctions outlined below. Sanctions are intended for willfully violating the policy, not attempting to expedite a purchase to meet a legitimate business need.

\item Sanctions
\label{sec:org2bc5a76}

Any personnel who violates this policy will be referred to HR for disciplinary action. Such action may include but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item A notification of policy violation in personnel file
\item A limitation on compensation increases for the current rewards cycle
\item Removal of access from one or more information systems
\item Termination
\item Legal action
\item Referral to professional boards for disciplinary action
\item Other actions not listed here
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Project Related purchases
\label{sec:org084ca8f}

Project related purchases, which are line-item expenses from a project WBS budget will go through the normal RFQ and RFP processes as outlined by Purchasing depending on the size of the purchase in question. All such purchases will have the associated RFQ/RFP paperwork filed with the PMO as well as Purchasing, and will be included in quarterly forecast budget statements. No hardware or software may be purchased from a project WBS that is not part of the defined project scope. If a project needs items that are not already in scope, a change request must be filed with the PMO and any budget adjustments must first be applied prior to the filing of the RFQ/RFP.

If it is the case that the time delay for change request processing and the RFQ/RFP process will delay the project timeline and the manager's corporate card purchasing power is sufficient to cover the cost of the purchase and the items to be purchased are already contained in the CMDB, this is a case where the exception path outlined above may be authorized by a director-level or higher employee without the possibility of sanctions being imposed.

\item Non-Project Related Purchases
\label{sec:org226fbcc}

For non-project related purchases which are already in the normal purchase catalogue and CMDB, a request will be submitted through the purchasing web-store and routed to the employee's direct supervisor for approval. Once approved, purchasing will deliver the items from the warehouse if in stock and then resupply the warehouse as needed, or, if not in stock, will submit an order to an appropriate supplier on behalf of the employee.

\item All Project and Non-Project Purchases
\label{sec:orga6144c9}

All hardware will be item-tagged, and the tag numbers recorded in the configuration inventory database for tracking. Software purchases will have the software serial number or license number as applicable entered into the inventory database for tracking.

\item Verification
\label{sec:org3fae020}

Verification of the above will be conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\item All hardware items will be subject to annual validation by hand inspection
\item All software serial/license numbers will be subject to automated validation by security software scans
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Overall Responsibility}
\label{sec:org720ea7a}

Overall responsibility for this policy falls to Purchasing. General questions about this policy can be directed to the Help Desk. Legal questions about this policy can be directed to the legal team.

\item Expectations
\label{sec:org7c17f17}


As this is a fully Agile DevSecOps environment, traditional Change Management is not practiced here. Each Agile DevOps team is responsible for their own production environment where a practice of continuous automated test/release is practiced.

The following standards will be adhered to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each Product Manager will establish the Availability target for their service product in terms of a number of 9's. For example 3-9's would be 99.9\% availability.
\item Each Availability target will take into account the user bases' ability to detect unavailability. For example, typical ISP's have an availability range of between 2-9s and 2.5 9's. So availability much higher than that is wasted opportunity cost.
\item From the Availability target, each team will establish an ``Error Budget,'' the amount of time a system is allowed to be down for any reason, from feature release to failure over any time period.
\item The Product Manager will establish appropriate Service Level Indicators and Service LEvel Objectives to measure and monitor adherence to the Availability target and Error Budget.
\item The DevOps team will be free to release on-demand to production so-long as the error-budget is not exceeded during any given time window.
\item Any code released to production will have gone through the following gates:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An Automated Build Pipeline with compliance checks for coding standards
\item An Automated testing Pipeline with full Unit and Regression testing
\item An Automated release Pipeline with full security checks for security and governance standards
\end{enumerate}
\item Once the error budget is broached, no more releases will be permitted until the error budget is replenished.
\end{enumerate}

\item Verification
\label{sec:org3768d8c}

Verification of the above will be conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dashboards will exist for each service tracking SLO's for all established SLI's
\item Product Managers will report on their Availability targets and Error Budget management at weekly PMO meetings
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Overall Responsibility}
\label{sec:org45b02fc}

Overall responsibility for this policy is the PMO. General questions about this policy can be directed to the Help Desk. Legal questions about this policy can be directed to the legal team.
