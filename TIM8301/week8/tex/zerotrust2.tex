          \begin{itemize}

            \item All resources are accessed securely regardless of location
            \item Assume all network traffic posses a potential threat
            \item Adopt a least-privilege strategy for all assets
            \item Inspect and log all traffic
            \item Robust and tested business continuity and recovery strategy
            \item Blockchain underlies recording of all transactions
          \end{itemize}

          \note[item]<1-> {\scriptsize{\textcite{collierZeroTrustSupply2021} provided the concepts of zero trust in the supply chain.}}
