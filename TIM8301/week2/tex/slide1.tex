  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Large companies are large targets

          \note[item]<1-> {\scriptsize{Uber, Facebook, Financial companies and others have lost control of billions of customer records in recent years \parencite{zadehCharacterizingCybersecurityThreats2020}. Between the cost of lost data, fines, lawsuits, and identity theft monitoring costs of impacted customers, the cost to organizations can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. }}

    \item<2-> Cybersecurity breaches have multi-factorial negative impacts

          \note[item]<2->{\scriptsize{Cybersecuirty breaches reduce customer and investor trust, negatively impact market value, negatively impact share price, and have the potential to negatively impact customer revnue. A 2014 report estimated that the cost to an institution averages \$201.21 \parencite{zureichCybersecurityContinuingEvolution2015}.}}

    \item<3-> Legal implications can be severe

          \note[item]<3-> {\scriptsize{Successful litigation against companies found to have suffered preventable data breaches have taken a variety of forms: shareholder suits to recover losses in stock value; securities fraud class action suits; class actions suits by those who's data was compromised; and enforcement actions by government regulatory bodies \parencite{hookerYouVeBeen2016}.}}
