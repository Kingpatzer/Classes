  \frametitle{Specific Changes to Leverage Security as a Value Opportunity}
  \framesubtitle{}

  Agile organizations requires new paradigms of leadership, Particularly around governance issues

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Every employee is accountable to always be learning how to do security better
    \item Security must be a cultural touchstone
    \item Every employee must be empowered to do security better
    \item Policy must follow sound practice, not dictate it or constrain it
    \item Leadership must be about results not process
  \end{itemize}
          \note[item] {\scriptsize{Switching the focus from being about what we as a company do to comply with CISSP or NIST or any other standard, to what we provide to our stakeholders as a value proposition changes the conversation from security as a bolt-on afterthought to security as a feature adding customer value. Apple is masterful at this \parencite{appleincPrivacy2021}. Consider the messaging from Apple: ``Privacy is a fundamental human right.'' Apple isn't selling security, they aren't selling a product. They are protecting their customer's human rights! Who wouldn't want to be part of that equation? By changing access management from an audit mandated extra to a customer-centric feature, Apple creates value and increases revenue. }}
