  As an exmaple of how focusing on security as value provides opportunities

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We ensure you can always do what you need to as a customer
    \item We focus on establishing trust between users, systems, suppliers, business partners, and our employees
    \item We ensure no one has access to your data without your explicit permission

          \note[item] {\scriptsize{Switching the focus from being about what we as a company do to comply with CISSP or NIST or any other standard, to what we provide to our stakeholders as a value proposition changes the conversation from security as a bolt-on afterthought to security as a feature adding customer value. Apple is masterful at this \parencite{appleincPrivacy2021}. Consider the messaging from Apple: ``Privacy is a fundamental human right.'' Apple isn't selling security, they aren't selling a product. They are protecting their customer's human rights! Who wouldn't want to be part of that equation? By changing access management from an audit mandated extra to a customer-centric feature, Apple creates value and increases revenue. }}
