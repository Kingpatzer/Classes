  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform quality audits as part of operational support at every supplier globally
    \item Issue and track compliance requests to suppliers to align to sustainability and quality targets
    \item Audit suppliers to comply with Dodd-Frank Act with regard to ``conflict minerals''
    \item Audit suppliers to comply with OECD guidance on ``conflict minerals''
  \end{enumerate}

\note[item]{\scriptsize{The regulatory burden for operations of medical device manufacturing extends down the supply chain.}}
\note[item]{\scriptsize{Of particular importance are two specific controls, Dodd-Frank and OECD guidance as relate to conflict minerals. These are mineralst that are sourced from war zones or nations under sanctioned regimes \parencite{alaliConflictMineralsDisclosure2018}. Ensuring the legality of sourcing of materials in the supply chain is not unique to medical device manufacturing. However, due to the significant use of rare minerals in complex medical devices, this supply chain management aspect of operations is of particular significance. }}
\note[item]{\scriptsize{Along with the legal requirements for complying with trade regulations, due to the very low tolerance for device failures of any sort, quality management at every step of the supply chain is an essential element of operations management that, while not unique to medical device manufacturing, is arguably of greater significance than for most other industries.}}
