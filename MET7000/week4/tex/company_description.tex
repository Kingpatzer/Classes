  \begin{itemize}
    \item Public company
    \item IT network contains sensitive data
    \item Data is sensitive as intellectual property and patient data
    \item Data disclosure could result in harm to patients
    \item Author is not authorized to disclose the company identity

      \note[item]{\scriptsize{The target company is a client of Accenture PLC who manufactures medical devices and equipment. As such, security is a major concern. This is both because internal documents relating to their device development and intellectual property are of necessity contained within their IT infrastructure, but also because medical devices themselves as IT products present themselves as targets for hackers and malicious actors \parencite{hagerSecuringPrivateMedical2020}.}}

      \note[item]{\scriptsize{The company employs an IT department of several thousand people dedicated not to product development but to the maintenance and support of internal IT structures. Roughly 400 people are dedicated to the support of infrastructure, including IT security.}}

      \note[item]{\scriptsize{The author is a senior consultant with Accenture PLC and lacks NDA disclosures from both the target company and Accenture to divulge any specific identifying information about the target company.}}
