The additional cost reduction is possible in the labor intensive activities of customer-specific customization of cloud services, tools support, and customer-facing service management. These essential service delivery processes are excellent candidates for standardization and automation using the cloud computing principles. We present examples of such processes and potential for optimization in these processes.},

  abstract = {Effective patch management is critical to ensure the security of information systems that modern organizations count on today. Facing numerous patch releases from vendors, an information technology (IT) manager must weigh the costs of frequent patching against the security risks that can arise from delays in patch application. To this end, we develop a rigorous quantitative framework to analyze and compare several patching policies that are of practical interest. Our analyses of pure policies—policies that rely on a single metric such as elapsed time or patch severity level—show that certain policies are never optimal and no single policy may fit all information systems uniformly well. Depending on the context parameters, particularly the setup and business disruption costs for patching, either a time-based approach or an approach based on the cumulative severity level may be effective. To develop a more complete guideline for policy selection, we decipher hybrid policies that combine multiple metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to verify the robustness of our analytical results. Overall, our paper establishes a comprehensive framework for analyzing various patching policies and furnishes useful insights for IT managers.},

  abstract = {As device integration continues to expand across the global market of the healthcare industry, the threats of data loss, exploitation and device control by nefarious actors are negative outcomes we are seeking to avoid. Medical device manufacturers in the U.S. market are required to comply with federal regulations like quality system regulations (QSRs) however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not conduct premarket testing or evaluations of implemented software on said devices, and is even less concerned with it once the hardware has been officially launched into the marketplace. The responsibility for validation of software design changes, penetration testing, and simulations regarding IoT security falls upon the manufacturer. Smart healthcare is the integration of digital solutions to improve patient outcomes and the operational efficiency of the facility. Privacy in the healthcare sector is the practice of ensuring the security and confidentiality of patient records, dependent upon the discretion of healthcare providers and the communication methods that are employed. Complex problems are those in which solutions can be derived from differing perspectives to achieve multiple results applicable to the scenario.We approach this subject from a systems perspective and emphasize taking actionable steps to achieve long term change in the policy, technical and social aspects of this complex problem. Due to the scale of the industry, individual scrutiny for each revision and update of all healthcare sector products by a third party is an unrealistic expectation. The keystone of our solution is to encourage the instantiation of a new NIST standard that would encompass the healthcare sector and the medical devices that are used within it. This categorization change positively influences device manufacturers’ access to the standards that are currently relevant within their domain.},

  abstract = {Given how the "patching treadmill" plays a central role for enabling sites to counter emergent security concerns, it behooves the security community to understand the patch development process and characteristics of the resulting fixes. Illumination of the nature of security patch development can inform us of shortcomings in existing remediation processes and provide insights for improving current practices. In this work we conduct a large-scale empirical study of security patches, investigating more than 4,000 bug fixes for over 3,000 vulnerabilities that affected a diverse set of 682 open-source software projects. For our analysis we draw upon the National Vulnerability Database, information scraped from relevant external references, affected software repositories, and their associated security fixes. Leveraging this diverse set of information, we conduct an analysis of various aspects of the patch development life cycle, including investigation into the duration of impact a vulnerability has on a code base, the timeliness of patch development, and the degree to which developers produce safe and reliable fixes. We then characterize the nature of security fixes in comparison to other non-security bug fixes, exploring the complexity of different types of patches and their impact on code bases. Among our findings we identify that: security patches have a lower footprint in code bases than non-security bug patches; a third of all security issues were introduced more than 3 years prior to remediation; attackers who monitor open-source repositories can often get a jump of weeks to months on targeting not-yet-patched systems prior to any public disclosure and patch distribution; nearly 5\% of security fixes negatively impacted the associated software; and 7\% failed to completely remedy the security hole they targeted.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a current trend that reveals the next-generation application architecture and it is estimated that by 2013 the cloud market will have reached \$8.1bn. While cloud services such as webmail, Flickr and YouTube have been widely used by individuals for some time, it not until relatively recently that organisations have began to use cloud services as a tool for meeting their IT needs. This study aims to investigate how cloud computing is understood by IT professionals and the concerns that IT professionals have in regard to the adoption of cloud services. The study was carried out in Taiwan and used a survey by interview approach to understand IT professionals’ understandings and concerns about cloud computing. The findings of the study suggest that while the benefits of cloud computing such as its computational power and ability to help companies save costs are often mentioned in the literature, the primary concerns that IT managers and software engineers have are compatibility of the cloud with companies’ policy, IS development environment, and business needs; and relative advantages of adopting cloud solutions. The findings also suggest that most IT companies in Taiwan will not adopt cloud computing until the uncertainties associated with cloud computing, e.g. security and standardisation are reduced and successful business models have emerged.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud has been attracting more and more customers as it provides the highest level of flexibility by offering configurable virtual machines (VMs) and computing infrastructures. Public VM images are usually available for customers to customize and launch. However, the 1 to N mapping between VM images and running instances in IaaS makes vulnerabilities propagate rapidly across the entire public cloud. Besides, IaaS cloud naturally comes with a larger and more stable attack surface and more concentrated target resources than traditional surroundings. In this paper, we first identify the threat of exploiting prevalent vulnerabilities over public IaaS cloud with an empirical study in Amazon EC2. We find that attackers can compromise a considerable number of VMs with trivial cost. We then do a qualitative cost-effectiveness analysis of this threat. Our main result is a two-fold observation: in IaaS cloud, exploiting prevalent vulnerabilities is much more cost-effective than traditional in-house computing environment, therefore attackers have stronger incentive; Fortunately, on the other hand, cloud defenders (cloud providers and customers) also have much lower cost-loss ratio than in traditional environment, therefore they can be more effective for defending attacks. We then build a game-theoretic model and conduct a risk-gain analysis to compare exploiting and patching strategies under cloud and traditional computing environments. Our modeling indicates that under cloud environment, both attack and defense become less cost-effective as time goes by, and the earlier actioner can be more rewarding. We propose countermeasures against such threat in order to bridge the gap between current security situation and defending mechanisms. To our best knowledge, we are the first to analyze and model the threat with prevalent known-vulnerabilities in public cloud.},
