  \begin{itemize}
    \item ERP Transformations is a multi-year process

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{The current request to implement 5 new technologies in one year is only realistic if the technologies in question verge upon the trivial. Large-scale enterprise transformations in supply chain space to new technology stacks take several years to complete successfully  \parencite{hartleyTortoiseNotHare2019}.}}

    \item The ERP Transformation Roadmap needs to address:

          \begin{itemize}
            \item Roadmap
            \item Operating Model
            \item Current State
            \item Process
            \item Solution Design
          \end{itemize}

 \note[item]{\scriptsize{The Consulting firm \textcite{kpmgERPStrategyRoadmap2018} outlines what is involved in an ERP journey to a new technology. There internal changes that need to happen, such as defining the vision and aligning that to business strategy, and decommissioning old technology. External demands can also impact the effort.}}
