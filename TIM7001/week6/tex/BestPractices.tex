           \end{itemize}

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{Companies that lead in technology adoption have well-developed roadmaps that link technology initiatives to specific strategic corporate goals.

But in any case, if the underlying foundational systems are not updated and current, likely issues will result that can derail projects quickly \parencite{hartleyTortoiseNotHare2019}. }}
