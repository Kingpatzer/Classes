    \item \alert{Technology adoption} is a multi-factorial problem that requires careful planning to ensure success

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{Technology adoption is impacted by multiple factors that include change management practices, perceived utility, perceived ease of use, psychological needs, personal values, and others \parencite{partalaUnderstandingMostInfluential2015}}}

    \item Successful \alert{best practices} should inform planning

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{Best practices in project management disciplines are strongly correlated to project success \parencite{besnerDiscriminatingContextsProject2008}. High risk projects such as major technology implementation efforts should therefore understand and utilize best practices where possible.}}

    \item Example plans for \alert{Block-chain SCM} can provide a framework for other technology implementations

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{As one of our role-outs this year will include a Block-chain SCM integration initiative, that high-risk, high-priority project will form the basis of an plan to be examined in this presentation.}}

    \item Measurements and metrics must be used to \alert{evaluate successful integration}


          \note[item]{\scriptsize{Core measures and metrics have been used to empirically determine some best practices that correlate innovation capability and business performance \parencite{zimmermannHowSupplyChain2020}. Therefore it is worthwhile to consider specific measures and metrics to be used to understand if a program results in successful technology adoption.}}
