  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> A sociological theory of how reality is constructed and understood

          \note[item]<1-> {\scriptsize{Arising in the 1980s, ANT attempts to explain how people's reality is constructed within their understanding. }}
          \note[item]<1-> {\scriptsize{ANT suggests that sociological forces drives how we come to understand any phenomenon.}}

    \item<2-> A ``constructivist'' theory

          \note[item]<2-> {\scriptsize{For ANT, reality is built up from social functions of language, neworks, and other actors.}}

    \item<3-> Metrics, Methods, Tools, and Technologies serve in performative functions
          \note[item]<3-> {\scriptsize{For ANT, everyone, and everything performs the role of an actor. This includes individual assumptions, beliefs, and statements. Our understanding arises from the networked relationships between all the individual actors we are exposed to.}}
