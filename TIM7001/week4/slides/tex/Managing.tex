  \begin{itemize}

    \item A key to properly managing anything is proper measures and metrics
    \item But no link between measures of innovation and firm performance

          \note[item]{\scriptsize{This lack of assocation is called out in a study by \textcite{melendezLiteratureReviewMeasurement2019}. Who also noted that as of the date of the study, only 17 primary studies existed on Innovation Management.}}
          \note[item]{\scriptsize{Further this is a real problem for academics according to \textcite{tiddInnovationManagementContext2001} as the disassociation between innovation and firm performance suggests that it isn't precisely clear to practitioners or academics exactly what ``innovation'' is that we can measure and manage it. }}
