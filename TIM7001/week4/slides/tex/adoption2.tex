  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Researchers have shown that ideas about blockchain can change

          \note[item]<1-> {\scriptsize{Research by \textcite{fossowambaBigDataAnalytics2018} explored the question from the perspective of what made adoption more likely. They found that the (false) ideas about blockchain adoption could be strongly impacted.}}

    \item<2-> In accordance with ANT, sharing of knowledge, ideas, best practices, and use-case information improved adoption rates.

          \note[item]<2-> {\scriptsize{This result is in accordance with what ANT would predict. Each of these bits of information is considered an actor in ANT, and when the preponderance of actors indicate a new belief should become predominate in a social context, then that should become the accepted belief. This demonstrates two things: first that adoption of technology is a sociological phenomenon; second, that this phenomenon does in fact align to ANT predictions. }}
