\abstract{Blockchain technology is not being adopted within supply-chain management at the rate researchers have long predicted despite its many proven advantages. This presents a challenge to explain what is in essence a sociological phenomenon, as the technological barriers to adoption are relatively easily overcome as companies such as Maersk and Starbucks have shown. Actor-Network theory is a theory which explains how knowledge and beliefs arise out of the relationship between individuals and the objects of their study. }
