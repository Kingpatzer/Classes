\section{Executive Summary}

This report outlines challenges to deploying new technology, specifically a blockchain Supply-chain management tool, globally. Many of these challenges can also exist in a local context. This report is to provide information to the business leadership team to guide issue identification and resolution by outlining how challenges to global deployments of new technology can be managed. Technological and non-technological challenges to implementation and adoption are discussed. Further, the importance of ethical business decision making and incorporating corporate social responsibility into global business decision making in an age of blockchain SCM technology is touched upon.

This report is not an extensive dive into all possible challenges that might be encountered with a blockchain SCM global implementation. Rather it is an attempt to outline how challenges can arise from multiple arenas, such as technological demands interacting with local infrastructure, sociological and psychological concerns, and regulatory mis-matches. By outlining how such challenges can be met, this report aims to model for management the process of identifying, and planning responses, to challenges early in the project life-cycle.
