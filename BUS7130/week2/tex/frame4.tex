\begin{frame}{When do we create value for our customers and ourselves?}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Value creation in technology is relational \parencite{ramaswamyOfferingsDigitalizedInteractive2018}
    \item Value creation in technology is aspirational
    \item Value creation in technology is complex
  \end{itemize}



  \note[item]{New technology offerings create the most value when they develop, enrich, and facilitate an ecosystem of interconnected customer interactions. Social networks exist whenever companies allow for their customers to interact with each other. An area of prime growth for Accenture.}
  \note[item]{Companies are transforming themselves in aspirational ways, and value is created for Accenture clients when Accenture is successful in facilitating these aspirational changes. Such as providing CRM capabilities that allow clients to deeply know, analyze and interact with customers via data mining and AI capabilities.}
  \note[item]{Such systems involve numerous components requiring deep expertise across multiple arenas as no single technology solution provides all of the necessary functionality. Rather it is a complex melange of constantly shifting components that must be expertly managed. }
  \note[item]{Accenture produces value when we succeed in orchestrating better relationships between clients and customers through aspirational technological gains. Accenture creats value for itself when clients succeed.}
