\section{Introduction}

There are limited to position Accenture for strategic advantage.
According to \textcite[][chapter 8]{Tracy2015} Accenture has eight strategic
variables to consider ``products, services, customers, markets, finances,
people, technology, and production capability.'' These variables can be
considered with respect four basic strategies: specialization, differentiation,
segmentation, and concentration (ibid, chapter 10).

In order for a strategy to adequately succeed, it must align with the
organization's mission, vision, and values. However, \textcite{cadyMissionVisionValues2011} notes that while more than 80\% of
organizations have mission statements, ``only 40\% of those statements appeared
to reflect reality.'' Accenture's mission statement does appear to be in that
40\% category, with the key element of the mission statement being to ``meet
clients wherever they are on their path to change -- in every industry across
the globe -- and partner with them to create lasting value.'' Accenture's vision
includes items such as ``building a future of shared, success, focusing on the
environment, and driving innovations and impact in global development.''
Accenture highlights eight core values: client value creation, one global
network, respect for the individual, having the best people, integrity and
stewardship.

First we will examine how the variables Tracy outlines align to Accenture's
mission, vision, and values. Then, we will consider which of the four basic
strategies best fits with the organization. This will include considerations of
how this strategy aligns with our prior customer and competitor analysis.
