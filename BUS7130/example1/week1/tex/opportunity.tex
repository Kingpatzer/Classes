\subsection{Opportunity}

Economic expansion in Asia, Africa, and South America has been a source of growth for Accenture \parencite{AccenturePLC2019}. Moreover, aid commitments to these regions, particularly sectional aid aimed at eduction, provide evidence that continuing economic expansion is both possible and likely for the long term \parencite{marutaForeignAidInstitutional2020}. While near-term impacts from COVID-19 are not entirely predictable, and likely negative, Accenture is well positioned to take advantage of a long trend of development in these regions.

Additionally, Accenture is a leader in deploying ``cloud'' solutions around the world. Cloud computing is the newest computing paradigm and involves allowing companies to stand up expansive, complex infrastructure on an as-needed basis for very low marginal costs. This brings the opportunity for unprecedented economic growth \parencite{asaduzzamanGeospatialCyberinfrastructureRegional2020}. Accenture is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by Cloud computing, having been a key player in both the initial development of the technology and of commercialization of both Cloud technologies and ``internet of things'' infrastructures.
