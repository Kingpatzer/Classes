\note[item]{We are a leader in numerous areas, particularly in cloud technology
  \parencite{asaduzzamanGeospatialCyberinfrastructureRegional2020}. We also have strong capabilities in rising areas of AI, plus a reputation as a highly regarded strategy, implementation, and operational support partner.}
\note[item]{We are struggling with excess capacity \parencite{owusuAccentureCut25} and
  have minimal secondary products or secondary markets we serve. This makes us vulnerable to slowdowns in our primary business.}
\note[item]{Growth Markets in Asia and Africa still hold great promise for
  future expansion. Further, we have room to grow in Europe as
  well\parencite{marutaForeignAidInstitutional2020}.}
\note[item]{Globally, our most serious competition comes from groups like Tata,
  multi-capability organizations like IBM, growing low-cost global competitors
  such as Cognizant, and strong regional players with global ambitions such as Capgemini.}
