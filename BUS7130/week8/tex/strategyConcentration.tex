\note[item]{\scriptsize{In the modern era of business, all companies are technology companies, regardless of their industry \parencite{walkerAllCompaniesAre2018}. But few companies are actually technologically savvy. They need technology to compete, but their competitive advantaage and core competencies lay outside of the technology realm.}}
