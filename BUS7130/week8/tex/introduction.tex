  \item{Analyzing overall industry and markets }
  \item{Multi-day workshop on strategy development}

\end{itemize}

The purpose of this presentation is to consolidate the findings of this work, and present the final strategy recommendations for Accenture PLC with respect to how to position the company across the four primary strategic themes of specialization, differentiation, segmentation, and concentration.


\note[item]{\scriptsize{It should be stressed that in order for this work to be meaningful and the resulting plan to be a success, that leadership support for the implementation of the plan is clear, unambiguous, and backed by concrete actions as well as robust, consistent communication across all levels of the organization.}}
\note[item]{\scriptsize{This plan should not be considered to be inviolate in the face of changing market conditions or disruptions to the industry as a whole. Just as Accenture had to pivot from prior strategic goals in order to address the impacts of COVID-19 on our business model, so to should this plan be seen as a guide that is only valid so long as underlying assumptions are upheld. Accenture must remain willing to rebase this plan should shifts in the underlying economy, working conditions, market health or other factors warrant such action.}}
