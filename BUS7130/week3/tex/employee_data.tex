\section{Collecting Employee Insights}

To unerstand the client perspective, it is important to ensure that Accenture is gathering as much data about client engagements as possible. Accenture has a number of already existing means of gathering information about client needs. Accenture runs client based, industry based, and geography based focus groups. Accenture surveys clients about every aspect of every engagement looking for information on quality of service, responsiveness of service, value provided, and missed opportunities. Accenture holds client-focused discussion groups on a quarterly basis for every Diamond+ client.

Specifically for this effort, an employee survey will be utilized. This survey can be found in the Appendix. The purpose of this survey is to validate the information that Accenture already possesses about most clients.

This survey is not intended to replace or eliminate any of the existing Accenture tools that are utilized to understand current and potential client needs.
