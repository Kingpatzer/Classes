\section{Introduction}

Having completed the strategic analsyiss, this preliminary draft report is the penultimate step to finalizing the strategic plan for Accenture PLC. This effort began with a SWOT analysis, an examination of value ccreation, and deep dives into customer demographics and competitor analysis. Various competing strategic ideas were compared and analyzed in light of these factors, and the ideas were then examined in light of the four strategic factors outlined by \textcite{Tracy2015}.

This document aims to clarify and optimize the strategic plan, and provide clear and concise information necessary to create the final presentation to corporate leadership.
