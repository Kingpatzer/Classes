\section{Strategic Intelligence and Gathering Analysis}

A SWOT analysis was performed \parencite{wagleSWOTAnalysisAccenture2020} and it was determined that there is still opportunities for significant growth in what Accenture defines as ``Growth Areas'' \parencite{AccenturePLC2019, marutaForeignAidInstitutional2020} which can be expected to extend for the significant future. Accenture was discovered to be a leader in cloud technology deployment, and area with opportunities for expansive economic growth \parencite{asaduzzamanGeospatialCyberinfrastructureRegional2020}. It was determined that there are extant threats related to economic uncertainity \parencite{siuChinaBeltRoad2019}.

With the key findings of the SWOT Analysis in hand, analysis gathering turned to Accenture's client base. Accenture's choice to broadly group their clients into three operational groups (Communications, Media and Technology; Financial Services; Health and Public Services; and, Products and Resources) was deemed reasonable. Of critical importance to Accenture are the ``length and depth of the relationships develop(ed),'' with 95\% of the top revenue clients having a relationship of 10 or more years with Accenture \parencite{wagleClientAnalysisAccenture2020}. The nature of Accenture's client relationships rests on the fact that the key entireprise systems and capabilities that Accenture is expert at implementing and supporting operationally are generally not the key competitive advantage of their clients. These systems require a high degree of specialized knowledge to implement as well as cultural transformation to sustain \parencite{aboabdoImplementingEnterpriseResource2019,kimpelMeasuringImpactCulture2020}.
