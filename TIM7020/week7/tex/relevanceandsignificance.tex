\section{Relevance and Significance}

This problem exists as for practitioners in SMEs. BD\&A, Blockchain, and AI are being utilized by larger firms to gain competitive advantage at a rapid rate \parencite{willettsBarriersSMEsAdoption2020,alazabBlockchainTechnologySupply2021}. Further, SME practitioners are unclear as to how to ensure that they have the best chance to extract value from their large IT investments \parencite{walshEnterpriseSystemInvestments2010}.

This impact is likely significant as SCM first-mover advantage in these technologies appears to offer some durable advantages over the near term \parencite{chenHowUseBig2015}. Given the financial advantages larger firms have over SMEs when it comes to IT investment, delayed, smaller investments in these technologies may lead to the erosion of market position for the SME firms, all other factors being equal.

This study will be significant in the scope of the study and in that it will use methods to provide empirical evidence of various leadership and firm characteristics related to success without disclosing the fact of the study to leadership. This will prevent any placebo or observational effects impacting the study. Further, if successful, the resulting textual analysis model would allow firms to perform their own analysis to identify areas for self-improvement prior to undertaking such large-scale efforts to improve their chance of success. This will give leaders and practitioners more insight into organizational and leadership gaps that can be relatively easily addressed.
