  Microservices are a new way of developing complex systems. They are built upon old ideas of keeping things small, simple, and singularly focused, combined with lessons learned about web-based development over the years.

  Cloud computing is a way of providing scalable, robust, network based services. Cloud computing has many cost advantages including not having to maintain a data center, and reducing staffing needs for supporting global IT infrastructure.

  Bringing them together, microservice cloud architectures are a means of developing and deploying complex yet scalable, available, monitorable, secure, and testable environments.
