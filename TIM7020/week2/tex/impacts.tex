\section{Impacts}

The most critical impact in facing this strategic problem is that there is evidence that becoming a data driven company is necessary for competitive advantage \parencite{alsghaierImportanceBigData2017}. Yet, it is also understood that many companies do not see the expected returns on BDA investment in terms of value creation \parencite{finkBusinessIntelligenceOrganizational2017}. Researchers have not focused sufficiently on how BDA translates into competitive advantage \parencite{trieuGettingValueBusiness2017} to provide answers to this problem. Further in many domains, such as supply chain management, business experts and computer science experts disagree as to the value of specific BDA returns \parencite{rossmannFutureSocialImpact2018}.

Researchers have noted that firm characteristics beyond simply investment into BDA capabilities are linked to value creation \parencite{bozicBusinessIntelligenceAnalytics2019}. This state of affairs means that most businesses, while recognizing the cost and performance advantages of engaging in BDA in the cloud, very few companies are actually doing this well, with only about 20\% of a company's ``cloud journey'' being complete \parencite{kenellyReasonsMostCompanies2019}. Small-to-mid-sized companies have some advantages in moving to the cloud given their small environments. Yet, their leadership is conflicted upon how and when to move the most critical and expensive computing environments. This comes from a few factors: the inability to move unique workloads due to technology or compliance constraints; the fear of vendor locking and the inherent complexity of working with multiple cloud vendors; and, importantly, the lack of relative skills (ibid).

The risks associated with lack of information system and infrastructure support, the capital outlay; and technical uncertainty \parencite{raguseoBigDataTechnologies2018} mean that small-to-mid-sized companies are caught in a ``no-win'' situation. They can either convert to IT as a service now, absorbing the associated costs with little guarantee of successful value generation from their BDA and cloud investments; or they can wait for industry clarity but then likely suffer by being behind early adopters.
