\section{Introduction}

The works selected for this annotated bibliography reflect he following research question: how do Business Intelligence \& Analytics, Data Management, and Business Agility \& Innovation coalesce to create value. The observation in practice is that many companies do not see the expected returns from their BI\&A investments \parencite{finkBusinessIntelligenceOrganizational2017}. Further, some researchers have suggested that there is insufficient focus on discovering how BI\&A investment translates to an actual competitive advantage \parencite{trieuGettingValueBusiness2017}. Therefore, this bibliography serves as a starting point to begin investigating this over-arching question.

The articles have been ordered in chronological order then alphabetically by primary author.
