The researchers pursue the network of principles by which Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI\&A) capabilities translate into business value within a Dynamic Capability Theory model. The specific research questions relate to do BI\&A improve dynamic capabilities; do dynamic capabilities improve operational marketing capabilities, and do BI\&A capabilities improve operational marketing capabilities. The study takes place specifically in the context of Brazil's retail telemarketing industry during a time of economic crisis. The authors find that the first two questions are positively correlated, while the last is inconclusive. This last finding is the most interesting as it the intuitive expectation is that it should based on the provided literature review. The study is well structured and has numerous test for data validity and consistency. The study's results are interesting because of the lack of findings of economic instability in the environments even though Brazil was in the throes of its worse financial crisis in some time when the data was collected. The study does provide some insight into one possible mechanism for BI\&A to generate value. However, its applicability may be limited by the specific context of the study and its focus on a single industry sector.
