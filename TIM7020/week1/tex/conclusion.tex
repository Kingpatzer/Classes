\section{Conclusion}

The above papers represent a variety of experiments, literature reviews, and meta-analysis of the current state of big data analytics (BDA), data warehousing, business intelligence (BI), and how those technologies relate to business agility and decision making in order to generate value. The papers collectively provide a sound basis to begin a research effort into this arena. Common themes seen amongst all the papers include the lack of understanding as to how BDA and BI actually translate into business value. Several papers explicitly call out a gap between research and practice, and the need for researchers to be better informed about current business concerns and focus. Few of the papers touched on broader considerations such as business strategy, market fit, and other considerations that can be arbiters of business success. Those that did, did so mainly in passing. Only one paper addressed the importance of data quality in being able to drive sound business decision making in a BD environment. That one paper noted the general insufficiency of current tools to keep up with common data quality problems in such environments.
